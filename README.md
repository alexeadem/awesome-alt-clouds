# 🌥️ Awesome Alt Clouds [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of **Alt Clouds** — a growing ecosystem of non-hyperscale, domain-specific, service-delivering cloud platforms.

Alt Clouds are differentiated cloud platforms that deliver critical, often specialized services (e.g. AI compute, identity, developer tools) on top of infrastructure. They are transparent, automatable, and essential to next-gen digital builders.

## Criteria
To qualify, platforms must:
- Have transparent public pricing.
- Offer self-service sign-up and automation.
- Provide a critical service with SLA or uptime transparency.
